# Initial Documentation for AcreetionOS

This is where the Initial Documentation for AcreetionOS lies. This repository is meant for an as-needed work playground.

None of this documentation is official; but once finished, will be left here as a paper trail for those who want to build their own Arch-based, or Arch-Like, distribution.
