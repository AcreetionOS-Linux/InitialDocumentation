# Package Maintainer Guidelines

Package Maintainers must possess the following:

	1) A machine capable of compiling x86_64 PKGBUILDs into binaries.
	
	2) A basic knowledge of PKGBUILDs

	3) Familiarity with an arch-based linux system.

What we would like maintainers to possess:

	1) An understanding of the overall linux file tree and/or structure.

	2) How to compile packages from source.

	3) A familiarity with AUR Helpers.
	
	4) A strong desire to help make the world a better place.

These are not strict requirements, but are strongly desired. If you do not have these skills, please do reach out! I can
for sure find you something to do if you want to help out!

## Limitations

When approaching AcreetionOS I have to think about what I, a maintainer, can support in terms of packages. Currently AcreetionOS will only support the x86_64 architecture due to a lack of maintainership and manpower.
The future of AcreetionOS may consider the idea of ARM64/32 binaries to be tabled until said otherwise.0 

Architectural requirements include the following:

	1) Building Machines: x86_64

	2) SystemD

	3) Decent Hardware

The maintainer should have decent enough hardware to get on the internet. If somebody desires to assist, but does not have 
access to proper hardware, contact @Sprungles and he and that person can talk about potentially loaning out resources via a compilation VM.
