Revisit b43-fwcutter, initial firmware has been removed from existence. Is currently archived at http://linuxwireless.sipsolutions.net/en/users/Drivers/b43/developers/.

Using Arch Linux PKGBUILD as temporary solution.

Revisit base and base-devel at a later time. This is a package with a large amount of other dependencies inside the package. In the meantime, we are leaving the base package using the PKGBUILD 
from Arch Linux.
