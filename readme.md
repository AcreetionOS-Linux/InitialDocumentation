# AcreetionOS Linux Initial Documentation

Welcome to AcreetionOS Linux's Initial Documentation Repo, a place to put everything in regards to developing AcreetionOS Linux.

## Project Overview

AcreetionOS Linux is a community-driven effort to build a lightweight, versatile Linux distribution that is easy to use, and ready for the masses on a community level, as well as a commercial interest. AcreetionOS Linux is currently based on Arch Linux, but the future goals are to be a parallel* distribution with our own base, code, and ideas. Our goal is to provide a solid foundation for both everyday users and developers, with a focus on simplicity, ease of use, and stability; all while keeping packages up to date and safe.

## Features

- Lightweight base system
- Standardized Package Selection
- User-friendly installation process
- x86_64 friendly.

## Getting Started

To get started with AcreetionOS Linux, you can:

1. Download the latest ISO from our [Website]("https://acreetionos-linux.github.io/")!
2. Create a bootable USB drive using tools like [Etcher]("https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher"), [Rufus]("https://rufus.ie/en/"), or [Ventoy]("https://ventoy.net/en/index.html").
3. Boot from the USB drive and follow the installation instructions

*     Ventoy MUST use GRUB MODE*
