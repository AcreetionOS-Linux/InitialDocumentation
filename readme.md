# AcreetionOS Linux First Steps Documentation

Are you wanting to help develop AcreetionOS? If so, keep reading! If not, check out our website at [acreetionos.online]("https://acreetionos.online") for a user-accessible easy-to-install image. If you need to know how to put it on your thumb drive, head over to [YouTube]("https://www.youtube.com/@AcreetionOS") for instructional content, or to know what we are working on in terms of AcreetionOS.

If you aren't quite ready to develop AcreetionOS, join us over at [Discord]("https://discord.gg/pQN7ZBFwzP") so yo know what is going on with the project! We tend to respond quickly there!

## Contributing to AcreetionOS

If you want to commit to AcreetionOS, we ask you do a couple of things. First, make sure you are in the [Discord]("https://discord.gg/pQN7ZBFwzP") for when we make changes. Next, go to [The AcreetionOS Community Page]("https://darrengames.ddns.net:2000/AcreetionOSCommunityEditions.html") and you will find GitHub Repos/Source links you can go too. You will then fork off the project and [Johnathan]("https://github.com/Sprunglesonthehub?tab=repositories") or [Darren]("https://github.com/cobra3282000/") will accept the pull request, if it is up to standards. If it is not, we will reach out to you either within the Issue, or Discord if you have your DMs open. From there we will build a communication path and build from there.

Once somebody has established the pattern of committing to the project with sufficient commits, then we may reach out in private about different roles within the project.

## Something that must be understood
We are not watching the Discord 24/7. We are usually working on something. We will do the best we can to reach out to you when we can. Anything contributed to AcreetionOS on GitHub MUST be Open-Source. If anything is not, it will be rejected. If you want to talk about proprietary implemenetation of anything, reach out to us on Discord and we will have a discussion about if it is possible to implement.

## Contact

For questions, suggestions, or support open an issue on [Github]("https://github.com/AcreetionOS-Linux") or our email, [acreetionos@gmail.com]("mailto:acreetionos@gmail.com")x. 

Thank you for your interest in AcreetionOS Linux, we appreaciate all of you!
